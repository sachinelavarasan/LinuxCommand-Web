Linux
•	Linux is an open-source operating system like other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, iOS, Google android, etc.
•	An operating system is a software that enables the communication between computer hardware and software. It conveys input to get processed by the processor and brings output to the hardware to display it.
•	The Linux OS was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, which sprouted as an idea to improve the UNIX OS.
•	Linux is around us since the mid-90s. It can be used from wristwatches to supercomputers. It is everywhere in our phones, laptops, PCs, cars and even in refrigerators.

•	NASA. 
•	French Gendarmerie. 
•	US Department of Defense.

Disadvantages of Linux OS 
•	No single way of packaging software.
•	No standard desktop environment.
•	Poor support for games.
•	Desktop software is still rare.
Ubuntu
Linux is a generic term which is kernel and has several distributions whereas Ubuntu is one of the Linux kernel based distribution. Linux is secure and most of the Linux distributions do not need anti-virus to install whereas Ubuntu, a desktop-based operating system is super-secure among Linux distributions.

•	The user typically enters text with a computer keyboard and reads the output text on a computer monitor.
Terminal
terminal allows us to send simple text commands to our computer to do things like navigate through a directory or copy a file, and form the basis for many more complex automations and programming skills.

#- rmdir dir1
- Remove a directory with files in it.
#- rm -rf dir1
-r = recursively
-f = forcefully
- List history of your commands
#- history
#- hostname
- Lists your system name

#- hostnamectl
- Lists hostname and other system details
#- hostnamectl set-hostname linux
- Set your hostname to linux
- Reboot 
#- cat /etc/hostname 
- Can also be changed by editing the file 
#- Absolute Path: 

- Starts with /, for example: /home/test
- touch filename /home/test
#- Relative Path:
- Does not start with /
- Depends on your current directory
- Current directory is /home/test then;
- touch filename (Creates file in current directory)
# Command Path
 - which cd
 - which cat
 - which touch
Note: Which command shows the path to the command 
when run without using absolute path.
Path: /usr/bin/cd, /usr/bin/cat, /usr/bin/touch
- cd /bin
- ls (shows all commands)

Compression Tools:
- Compression tools are used to compress one or
more files or an archive to save space.
#- gzip
This command creates a compressed file of each of the
files specified and adds .gz extension to the files.
#- gzip filename
#- ls or ll (check files after compression)

- To uncompress use:
#- gunzip filename
or
#- gzip -d filename
# ls or ll (check files after decompression) 
You can also use bzip2 and bunzip2
#- bzip2 filename
#- bunzip2 filename or bzip2 -d filename

cat /etc/profile
Displays the contents of the file profile.
- Using more and less command:

#- more /etc/profile
Displays long text files one page at a time, starting
at the beginning.

#- less /etc/profile
Similar to more command but offers some extended
capabilities, it is also faster than more as it does
not need to read the entire file before it starts to
show.

- Using head and tail commands: 
Examples:
#- head /etc/profile
By default it shows first 10 lines of the file.
#- head -3 /etc/profile
This will show only the first 3 lines of a file.
#- tail /etc/profile
By default it shows last 10 lines of the file.
#- tail -3 /etc/profile
This will show only the last 3 lines of a file.

- Removing Files
